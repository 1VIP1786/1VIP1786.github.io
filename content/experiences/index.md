# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Vipul Patil**. I'm glad you're visiting my website! Below are some of my current projects and activities that I'm proud of. I'm deeply passionate about **MLOps** and **pipeline management** for machine learning, recognizing their critical importance in ensuring the successful deployment of ML solutions at scale. My journey through **cloud infrastructure** and **DevOps** has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am an advocate for the **serverless paradigm**, which I believe represents the future of scalable, efficient cloud computing.

Feel free to reach out via [📧 email](mailto:vipulpatil1786@gmail.com) for interesting conversations and collaboration opportunities.
